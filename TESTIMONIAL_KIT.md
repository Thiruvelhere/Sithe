# Testimonial Acquisition Kit

Use these templates to request testimonials from your beta users in Discord or via DM.

## 1. The "Soft Ask" (After they say something positive)

**Context:** A user says "This is cool" or "It works!" in Discord.

**You:**
> "Awesome, glad to hear that! 🙌
>
> We're putting together a small case study for our seed round investors. Would you mind if I quoted you on that?
>
> Or if you have 30 seconds, could you give me a 1-sentence blurb about **why you think Zypher is useful for [Their Use Case]**? It would be a huge help for the project!"

## 2. The "Direct DM" (For active users)

**Context:** You see a user who has been active or asked questions.

**You:**
> "Hey [Name]! 👋
>
> I noticed you've been exploring the SDK. I'd love to get your honest feedback.
>
> I'm currently collecting a few testimonials from our 'Founding Users' to feature on the website (with a backlink to your profile/project).
>
> Would you be open to sharing a quick thought on:
> 1. How easy was it to set up?
> 2. What problem does this solve for you?
>
> Thanks a ton!"

## 3. The "LinkedIn Shoutout" Request

**Context:** A user is very happy.

**You:**
> "That's amazing! 🚀
>
> If you're up for it, it would be incredible if you could share that on LinkedIn/Twitter and tag us. We'll repost it immediately to our network.
>
> No pressure at all, but it really helps get the word out!"

## 4. What to look for in a Testimonial

A good testimonial has 3 parts:
1.  **The Problem**: "We needed a way to prove our AI wasn't hallucinating..."
2.  **The Solution**: "Zypher's SDK was a drop-in solution..."
3.  **The Result**: "Now we can audit every single prompt."

**Example of a Perfect Testimonial:**
> "Integrating Zypher took us less than 10 minutes. It's the only solution we found that cryptographically binds the prompt to the output, which is a game-changer for our compliance requirements."
