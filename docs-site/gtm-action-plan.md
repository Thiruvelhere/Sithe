Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] is using AI for [use case]. 

Quick question: How do you prove to regulators that your AI outputs 
haven't been tampered with?

We built Zypher to solve this—zero-knowledge proofs that 
cryptographically verify AI authenticity.

[Social proof: X companies use us, including Y]

Worth a 15-min demo?

Best,
Thiruvel
Founder, Zypher
