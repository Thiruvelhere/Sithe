## 📧 Email Template

### Subject Line Options
1. "Help us build the future of AI verification (beta access)"
2. "Early access: Cryptographic proofs for AI (Zypher SDK)"
3. "ZK proofs meet AI—want to try it first?"

### Email Body

```
Subject: Early access: Cryptographic proofs for AI (Zypher SDK)

Hi [Name],

I came across your work on [specific project/post] and thought you'd be interested in what we're building.

**The problem:** There's no way to cryptographically prove that AI-generated content is authentic and hasn't been tampered with. This is a major issue for [DAO governance / compliance / content verification].

**Our solution:** Zypher uses zero-knowledge proofs (Groth16 + Poseidon) to create tamper-proof verification for AI interactions. Think "SSL for AI."

**Why I'm reaching out:** We're looking for 10 technical beta testers to try the SDK and provide feedback. You'd get:
- Early access to the SDK (before public launch)
- Direct line to the founding team
- Free credits on launch
- Recognition as a founding user

**What we need from you:**
- 30 minutes to integrate and test
- Honest feedback on the API, docs, and use cases
- Optional: Tweet about your experience

Interested? Reply and I'll send you access.

Best,
Thiruvel
Founder, Zypher
